Your Project
------------

### ← README.md

That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

### ← sketch

This folder contains your sketch (aka the code that draws stuff).
This is where you'll make your script for your game.
If you need to use several files, add more .js files and `import` them into your project.

### ← .gitignore

This file tells your computer not to send certain files to Glitch.
We'll learn about this in Lesson 5.

### ← index.html

This is your main page, accessible at \[project-name\].glitch.me. DON'T EDIT IT.
